:::tip

[Install the GraphQL packages](/V1/get-started/quick-setup/) before starting this section.

:::

In this section, we'll help you write a simple query to read a user's [connections](/V1/concepts/connection/) from the [social graph](/V1/concepts/social-graph/).

1. Initialize the GraphQL client:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetConnections.tsx"
const client = new GraphQLClient(CYBERCONNECT_ENDPOINT)
```

2. Write a query to get the `address` and `domain` of the user’s `followings` and `followers`:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetConnections.tsx"
const GET_CONNECTIONS = gql`
  query ($address: String!, $first: Int) {
    identity(address: $address) {
      followings(first: $first) {
        list {
          address
          domain
        }
      }
      followers(first: $first) {
        list {
          address
          domain
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```
