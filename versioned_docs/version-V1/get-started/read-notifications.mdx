[Install the GraphQL packages](/V1/get-started/quick-setup/) before starting this section.

In this section, we'll help you write a simple query to read a user's [notifications](/V1/concepts/notification/) from the [social graph](/V1/concepts/social-graph/). Also, we will show you how to acknowledge a notification and acknowledge all notifications. Here is an example on how to use these features.

## Read Notifications

1. Connect with User Wallet:
   Before checking notifications, you need to make sure that their crypto wallets are connected to your application.
   Check out the tutorial from [Connect with User Wallet](/V1/get-started/create-a-connection/#connect-with-user-wallet/).

2. Initialize the GraphQL client:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetConnections.tsx"
const client = new GraphQLClient(CYBERCONNECT_ENDPOINT)
```

2. Write a query to get the `unreadNotificationCount` and the list of the user’s `notifications`:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetNotifications.tsx"
import { gql } from 'graphql-request'

export const GET_NOTIFICATIONS = gql`
  query ($address: String!) {
    identity(address: $address, network: ETH) {
      unreadNotificationCount
      notifications {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          hasPreviousPage
          endCursor
          startCursor
        }
        list {
          id
          toAddress
          network
          namespace
          hasRead
          type
          timestamp
          ... on NewConnectionNotification {
            fromAddress
            connectionType
          }
          ... on BiConnectReceivedNotification {
            fromAddress
          }
          ... on BiConnectAcceptedNotification {
            fromAddress
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Make sure to check out the full list of fields available in the [CyberConnect API](/V1/cyberconnect-api/overview/).

## Acknowledge a Notification

1. To start, import `CyberConnect`, `Env`, and `Blockchain` into your application from the CyberConnect SDK:

```jsx title="/src/components/Notifications.tsx"
import CyberConnect, { Env, Blockchain } from '@cyberlab/cyberconnect'
```

2. Before creating a connection, you'll need to instantiate a `CyberConnect` object and initialize variables `namespace`, `env`, `chain` and `provider`:

```jsx title="/src/components/FollowButton.tsx"
const cyberConnect = new CyberConnect({
  namespace: 'CyberConnect',
  env: Env.PRODUCTION,
  chain: Blockchain.ETH,
  provider: window.ethereum,
})
```

3. In this tutorial, we'll help you implement a simple button that user can click on and acknowledge a notification. However, you can also acknowledge a portion of notifications because `ackNotifications([notificationId])` can take array of `notificationId`. After clicking, the function `ackNotificationsHandler` will send a request to MetaMask and, if successful, it will set the notification `hasRead` to `true` and alert the user the success message.

```jsx title="/src/components/Notifications.tsx"
const ackNotificationsHandler = async (notificationIds) => {
  if (!account) return
  if (!notificationIds) return

  try {
    await cyberConnect.ackNotifications(notificationIds)
    alert(`Success: you read this notification!`)
    await fetchNotificaions(account)
  } catch (err) {
    alert(`Failed: you have already read this notification!`)
    console.error(err.message)
  }
}
```

## Acknowledge All Notifications

We can also implement a simple button that user can click on and acknowledge all notifications. After clicking, the function `ackAllNotificationsHandler` will send a request to MetaMask and, if successful, it will clean all the notifications and set `unreadNotificationCount` to 0 and alert the user the success message.

```jsx title="/src/components/Notifications.tsx"
const ackAllNotificationsHandler = async () => {
  if (!account) return
  try {
    await cyberConnect.ackAllNotifications()
    alert(`Success: you cleaned all the notification`)
    await fetchNotificaions(account)
  } catch (err) {
    alert(`Failed: please connect your wallet!`)
    console.error(err.message)
  }
}
```
