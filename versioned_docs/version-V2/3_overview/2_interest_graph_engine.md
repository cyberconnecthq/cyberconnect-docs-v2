CyberConnect has two components to help developer build social applications: Social Data Network and **Interest Graph Engine**.

CyberConnect Interest Graph Engine indexes, aggregates onchain and offchain data sources related to an identity and its activities to create a holistic view. Developers could easily leverage the indexed data and the recommendation models for user acquisition and user retention.

## Indexing

Indexing system indexes data from _blockchains, decentralized stores, as well as off-chain platforms_ like Twitter to offer insights that can be used in various social contexts. These insights include social trading signals, gaming activities, DAO engagements, and more.

## Recommendation

Recommendation platform converts indexed data into graph representation to provide _graph-based data analysis and recommendations_. On top of this, a token-curated marketplace is built that empowers developers to build and curate better models together.
