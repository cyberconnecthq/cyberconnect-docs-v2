A connection that represents relationships between two identities. Social connections include following and subscribing to a creator, being friends with your buddies, belonging to an organization, and participating in activities.

## Follow

Follow is the simplest form of unilateral connection where one address follows another address. This address to address following connection is stored in cost-efficient decentralized storage Arweave. This is great for applications with light weight social graph needs like following another user’s wallet activity.

## Paid Subscribe

While `Follow` represents a directed relationship from one address to the other, `Subscribe` represent the relationship from one `address` to a `profile`. Profiles have the ability to being subscribed to with payment attached. Each user after creating a profile could set up rules for subscription. Each profile could specify the amount of token needed to pay for becoming a subscribers to that profile and subscribers will obtain a subscriber NFT.
