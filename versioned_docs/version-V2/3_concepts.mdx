## Identity

User-generated social profiles and on-chain address-related data that form the user’s decentralized identity. Whether it’s an NFT, an ENS name, a Twitter handle, or a DID, we map all of them to one holistic identity. In CyberConnect’s infrastructure, an identity is currently manifested thru either an address or a profile.

### Address

Users can bring their already familiar EVM addresses to CyberConnect and create new social data on applications built with CyberConnect.

### Profile

Although addresses are great as a decentralized identifier, they lack the functionality of more complex access control and key rotation which are crucial components in a social application. Profile is the entry point for every onchain actions and act just like a profile in web2 social applications. Each profile is a ERC-721 NFT similar to other onchain identity except that each profile owns its paid subscribers and contents. Each real user could also have multiple profiles. See a profile in action on [Link3](https://link3.to/shiyu).

## Content

User-generated content such as posts, videos, and publications. We also look at how people are engaging with such content through innovative smart contract-enabled ways like funding public goods, donating for charity, and governance. To build trust and authority, each content is tied to a profile, so users will need to create their profiles before they can create contents. Each content can be collected based on dynamic rules.

### Web3 Status Token (W3ST)

Web3 Status Token or W3ST (pronounced as “west”) is the web3 native way of recognizing, owning and utilizing one’s status. Each status is given by a profile to a user as long as the user satisfy the rules for gaining that status. The common status include “community member”, “investors” and “event participant”. Check out this blog for details about W3ST.

### Post

Each profile could create a new piece of content in the form of a post just like that on twitter or medium. However, by having those posts live on CyberConnect protocol, these posts become web3 native instrument for community engagement and financialization through users collecting those posts. Developers could create a content platform linked to funding public good where users could contribute some amount of token to each piece of article.

## Connection

A connection that represents relationships between two identities. Social connections include following and subscribing to a creator, being friends with your buddies, belonging to an organization, and participating in activities.

### Follow

Follow is the most simple form of unilateral connection where one address follows another address. This address to address following connection is stored in cost-efficient decentralized storage Arweave. This is great for applications with light weight social graph needs like following another user’s wallet activity.

### Paid Subscribe

Beyond the simplest form of following, users have the ability to being subscribed to with payment attached. Each user after creating a profile could set up rules for subscription. Each profile could specify the amount of token needed to pay for becoming a subscribers to that profile and subscribers will obtain a subscriber NFT.

## Middleware

To enable dynamic rules involved in collecting contents and paid subscription, CyberConnect protocol provides various middlewares. There are two types of middlewares, `CollectMiddleware` and `SubscribeMiddleware`. They are smart contracts with logic executed before and after `collect` and `subscribe` happens. Currently we support `PaidCollect` and `PaidSubscirbe` where users need to pay ERC20 token to collect a content or subscribe to a profile. We also support `PermissionedCollect` where the creator of the content specifies a whitelist.

## Namespace

By default, every user and interaction happens in a global namespace called “CyberConnect” to maximize user liquidity. At the same time, CyberConnect enables developers create social experiences in their own namespace where each user goes thru a “sign up” process by creating their profiles within that namespace and creating content and social connections in that namespace. This gives developers more power and control of their user flow and monetization.
