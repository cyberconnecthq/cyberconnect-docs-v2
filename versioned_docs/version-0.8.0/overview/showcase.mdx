### About Light

[Light.so](https://light.so/home) is a Metaverse Explorer enabling users to curate, discover, and explore meaningful interactions. For example, users can discover other users who contribute to the same DAOs, share an NFT collection and have attended the same events. User identities and activities can be viewed in an aggregated way.

### Achieve Social Connectivity **with CyberConnect**

[Light.so](http://Light.so) is built on top of the CyberConnect Protocol. CyberConnect enables users to follow and unfollow each other with proof on blockchains through the [JS SDK](/cyberconnect-sdk/connect-with-js-sdk/) and to query connection information and recommendations through the [Connection API](/cyberconnect-api/graphql-api/connections/) and [Recommendation API](/cyberconnect-api/graphql-api/recommendations/). Light.so creates a unique exploratory social experience native to the Metaverse by leveraging CyberConnect’s decentralized social graph and robust infrastructure.

### About Project Galaxy

[Project Galaxy](https://galaxy.eco/) is the largest Web3 credential data network. Built on an open and collaborative infrastructure, Project Galaxy helps Web3 developers and projects leverage credential data to build better products and communities. Meanwhile, data curators are rewarded for the usage of credentials in Project Galaxy’s Application Modules, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API.

### Manage User Identities and Credentials

[Galaxy ID](https://galaxy.eco/galaxyid/) integrates CyberConnect connections data by calling the [Identity API](/cyberconnect-api/graphql-api/identity/) to display users’ followers and following data. In this way, CyberConnect enables Galaxy’s social component in the form of user profile pages.

### Social Experiences in NFT Marketplace

[Grape.art](https://grape.art/) is the first non-custodial NFT marketplace on Solana built for communities to curate their own marketplaces. Social interactions on this platform are powered by CyberConnect’s [Social Graph](/concepts/social-graph/), which enables Web3 users to discover and form new connections. Together, CyberConnect and Grape Community continue to explore the potential of integrating social experiences into the NFT marketplace.

- **Data** **Ownership**: All your conversational data generated in Convo Space is always in your control and linked to your decentralized identity.

### Build User Reputations with CyberConnect

[Convo Space](https://theconvo.space/) integrates CyberConnect’s [Connection](/concepts/connection/) and [Identity](/concepts/identity/) fields as a source of reputation for their users. This data is then weighed and applied to compute an overall trust score for Ethereum addresses. Convo Space leverages this trust score to construct users’ membership verification in terms of reputation sources without revealing any personal traits.
