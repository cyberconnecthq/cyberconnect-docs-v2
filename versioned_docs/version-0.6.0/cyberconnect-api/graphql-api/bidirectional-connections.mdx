Bidirectional Connections API is used to query fields of [bidirectional connections](/concepts/bidirectional-connection/) between a given address and another address or a list of other addresses (50 max).

You can find the step by step instructions on how to set up GraphQL client in your application and write a simple **Get Bidirectional Connection query** in the [Read Connections](/get-started/read-connections/) section.

## Structure

The general pattern of `Bidirectional Connection` query is:

```graphql
biConnections(fromAddr String!, toAddrList [String!]!, network Network) [BidirectionalConnection!]!
```

| Field        | Type       | Description                                                                                | Required/Optional                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `fromAddr`   | String!    | The source address that you want to query bidirectional connections about                                | Required                          |
| `toAddrList` | [String!]! | A string list of addresses that you want to check if they have bidirectional connections with `fromAddr` | Required                          |
| `network`    | Network    | The blockchain network of the address you are querying about                               | Optional. Default value is `ETH`. |

With correct inputs, you will get a list of `BidirectionalConnection` objects, consisting of the following fields:

| Field           | Type         | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------ | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fromAddr `     | String       | The source address that you want to query bidirectional connections about                                                                |
| `toAddr`        | String       | An address that is given in `toAddrList`                                                                                                 |
| `state `        | BiConnState  | The bidirectional connection state between `fromAddr` and `toAddr`.                                                                      |
| `direction`     | Direction    | The direction of bidirectional connection state.                                                                                         |
| `namespace`     | String       | The namespace of this connection                                                                                                         |
| `network`       | Network      | The network that is given as the querying parameter                                                                                      |
| `createdAt`     | String       | The creation time of this connection                                                                                                     |
| `updatedAt`     | String       | The latest update time of this connection                                                                                                |
| `latestHash`    | String       | The proof hash of this connection. Please see [Proof of Connection](/protocol/proof-of-connection/) for detail design and implementation |

For `followStatus`, there will be two boolean variables: `isFollowed` and `isFollowing`.
For `state`, there will be four enum values: `EMPTY`、`PENDING`、`CONNECTD` and `BLACKLIST`. Our protocol defines a state machine to show relationship among these states and different bidirectional connection:

You also need `direction` to determine final state between `fromAddr` and `toAddr`, there will be three enum values: `BIDIRECTION`、`FROM_TO` and `TO_FROM`.

If state is `EMPTY`, the direction should be `BIDIRECTION`, it means the initial state between `fromAddr` and `toAddr`.

if state is `PENDING`, the direction can either be `FROM_TO` or `TO_FROM`, it means the direction of request sent from `fromAddr` to `toAddr` or from `toAddr` to `fromAddr`.

If state is `CONNECTED`, the direction should be `BIDIRECTION`, it means the bidirectional connection has been connected for both `fromAddr` and `toAddr`.

If state is `BLACKLIST`, the direction can either be `BIDIRECTION`, `FROM_TO` or `TO_FROM`, it means mutually block or the direction of block.

## Examples

### Fetch Proof Example

This is an example of a query to fetch `proof` data that you can also test out in the [Playground](/cyberconnect-api/playground/):

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
    defaultValue="javascript"
    values={[
        {label: 'Query', value: 'javascript'},
        {label: 'Response', value: 'json'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript
query ProofQuery {
  bidirectionalConnections(
    fromAddr: "0x9dd481d6c1656816bfd564151e29d57e041d2c8f", 
    toAddrList:["0xc76fbe40144ac56822c651b6e02497d4a576f23d"], 
    network: ETH) {
    from
    to
    latestHash
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
