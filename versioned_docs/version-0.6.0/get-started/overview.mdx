In this section, we will help you set up the environment and implement a simple integration with the CyberConnect Protocol. The starter project demonstrates how you can interact with several basic features of the protocol:

- [Create a connection](/get-started/create-a-connection/).
- [Verify a Twitter account](/get-started/verify-a-twitter-account/).
- [Read a user's decentralized identity](/get-started/read-identity/).
- [Read a user's connections](/get-started/read-connections/).
- [Read recommended connections for a user](/get-started/read-recommendations/).
- [Read a user's NFT ownership](/get-started/read-nft-ownership/).
