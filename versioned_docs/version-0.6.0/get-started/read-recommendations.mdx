:::tip

[Install the GraphQL packages](/get-started/quick-setup/) before starting this section.

:::

In this section, we'll help you write a simple query to get recommended [connections](/concepts/connection/) for a user from [social graph](/concepts/social-graph/).

1. Initialize the GraphQL client:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetRecommendations.tsx"
const client = new GraphQLClient(CYBERCONNECT_ENDPOINT);
```

2. Write a query to get a list of recommended connections for a user, including their `address`, `domain`, and `recommendationReason`:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetRecommendations.tsx"
export const GET_RECOMMENDATIONS = gql`
  query($address: String!) {
    recommendations(address: $address) {
      result
      data {
        list {
          address
          domain
          recommendationReason
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

Make sure to check out the full list of fields available in the [CyberConnect API](/cyberconnect-api/overview/).
