CyberConnect is a web3 <strong id="social-graph" class="boxBorder"> social network </strong> that enables developers to create social applications empowering users to own their digital identity, content, connections, and interactions.

It creates long-lasting on-chain connections through the power of its network. Developers can build innovative social applications where users own their identities and data, while creators can grow their audiences in a fairer, more direct, and decentralized environment.

## CyberConnect V3

<Tooltip anchorId="EVM-CHAIN" html="EVM network/chain here refers to any blockchain that can <br/>run the ethereum virutal machine and execute <br/>Ethereum smart contracts. CyberConnect is <br/>currently deployed on ETH & BNB." />

CyberConnect V3 is a set of powerful upgrades to the CyberConnect social network protocol to usher web3 social into a new, multi-chain future. It will power the next stage of hyper scalability for web3 social dApps and give users a social networking experience that feels familiar to web2.

V3 has three core components: CyberAccount, an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)-compatible identity infrastructure; CyberGraph, a censorship-resistant database to record usersâ€™ content + social connections; and CyberNetwork, a gas-efficient and scalable network to bring CyberConnect to the world. Over the course of the next two months, it will be deployed on six <strong id="EVM-CHAIN" class="boxBorderEVM"> EVM networks</strong>.
