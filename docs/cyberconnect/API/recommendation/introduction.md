The main entry point for address-based recommendations is the `Recommendations` type in `wallet`, itâ€™s used for finding information that might be interesting to a given wallet based on its historical transaction history, current balance & project interactions.

```graphql
type Recommendation(chainID: ChainID!) {
  tokenBalanceInfo(offset: Int, limit: Int): [TokenInfo!]
  tokenRecommendation(offset: Int, limit: Int): [TokenRecommendation!]
  userRecommendation(offset: Int, limit: Int): [UserRecommendation!]
}
```

There are 3 subfields/queries currently supported:

- `tokenBalanceInfo` is memory/heuristic-based while
- The two others (`tokenRecommendation` & `userRecommendation`) are model-based.
