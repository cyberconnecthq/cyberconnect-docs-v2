**Feeds** provide a familiar way of surfacing web3 data to users. In its simplicest form, a feed is just a collection of content sorted in a particular order. 

CyberConnect plans to launch several feeds in the near future, including (but not limited to):
1. User Feeds
   - Feeds catered to a specific user / address' content & on-chain interactions
2. Community Feeds
   - Feeds catered to a specific community's content & on-chain interactions (ex. Azuki holders)
3. Domain Feeds
   - Feeds catered to a specific domains' content & on-chain interactions (ex. Social, Defi, etc.)

The first feed we are introducing is a user feed based on ERC transfers. The `feed` fields under `Wallet` will return the latest ERC transfer history for a given address. To speed up the query you can choose to exclude the `token` field in your query (which is only used to get the token_address info).
