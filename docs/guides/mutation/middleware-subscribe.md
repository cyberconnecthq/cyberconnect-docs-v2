## Workflow

Set middleware for subscribe is a powerful API that allows developers to customize their apps and create a unique experience for their users. The API interacts with the smart contract and sets the defined rules on how it should behave for a specific action, such as subscribing to a profile.

1. First, data should be presented to the user in a readable format when signing from the wallet. To do that you’ll need to call the `createSetSubscribeDataTypedData` API that takes care of this.

    If you’re unfamiliar with typed data, you can read more about it [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712).

    This API sets the parameters for subscribing such as `tokenURI` and `middleware` so when a user subscribes to this profile, the Middleware will be triggered and the NFT minted will have the specified Token URI.

    In this example we are setting the `subscribePaid` middleware which will require the user to pay a fee to subscribe to the profile.<br/>

This API requires `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` token. You can learn more about it [here](/guides/authentication/user-login).

import ApolloCard from "@site/src/components/ApolloCard";

<ApolloCard queryName="createSetSubscribeDataTypedData" />

2. Second, once you received data in a readable format, you’ll need to get the user’s signature for it. Basically, you’ll need to write a function and pass it a `message` as a param and return the `signature` that it’s necessary for the next step.

3. Third, you’ll have to call the `relay` API that will broadcast the transaction and interact with the smart contract setting the middleware, you will need to put as params the `typedDataID` you received from `createSetSubscribeDataTypedData` mutation call and the user's `signature`.

:::caution

This API requires `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` token. You can learn more about it [here](/guides/authentication/user-login).

<ApolloCard queryName="relay" />

You can now verify the transaction by looking up the `txHash` from the response on [etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io). That’s it! You’re all done!
