## Contract & Project Level interactions stats

The `getProjectInteractionStats` and `getContractInteractionStats` provide lists of projects and contracts with which an address has interacted with, respectively. They also return general stats about those project/contract level interactions such as:

- The transaction counts - also broken down received vs sent
- first & last transactionsâ€™ timestamps
- sample transaction hash from the given interactions
