We've built a [recommendation](/concepts/recommend/) index into our protocol for general follow suggestions. The index jumpstarts by aggregating [connections](/concepts/connection/) from open data sources, including Ethereum blockchain, Foundation.app, Rarible, etc. It generates a personalized "recommended addresses to follow" list for every address.

The Recommendation API is to suggest such possible connections for users. It will return a list of addresses that a, have the same followers with the searched address, or, b, have already followed or been followed by the searched address on other platforms.

You can find the step by step instructions on how to set up GraphQL client in your application and write a simple **Get Recommendation query** in the [Read Recommendations](/get-started/read-recommendations/) section.

## Definition

The definition of `recommendations` query is:

```graphql
recommendations (address: String!, filter: RecommFilter, network: Network, first: Int, after: String) RecommendationResponse!
```

For input params:

| Field       | Type    | Description                                                                             | Required/Optional                                        |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`   | String! | The address that you want to get recommendations for                                    | Required                                                 |
| `filter`    | Enum    | Type of connection filter.                                                              | Optional. Currently supports `SOCIAL`.                   |
| `network`   | Network | The blockchain network for the queried address.                                         | Optional. Default value is `ETH`.                        |
| `namespace` | String  | The source of the connection.                                                           | Optional. Default value is `CyberConnect`.               |
| `first`     | Int     | The number of entries this query should return                                          | Optional. Default is `20` and the maximum value is `50`. |
| `after`     | String  | After which index this query should begin                                               | Optional. Default value is `-1`.                         |

For `first` and `after` usage, please refer to [Pagination](/resources/terminology/pagination/) section.

For returning fields, "SUCCESS" means you have made a successful request and can then use the data. You may see "INDEXING" for recommendation results if you have put in an address that has never been queried before. In such a case, our recommendation system will run in the background to get the results prepared. You can come back to check later.

`pageInfo` is used to do pagination. Also, you can refer to [Pagination](/resources/terminology/pagination/) section for more details.

There are 5 fields for each object in `list`:

| Field                  | Type   | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `address`              | String | The string of recommended address              |
| `domain`               | String | The string of recommended address' domain name |
| `avatar`               | String | The URL string of recommended address' avatar  |
| `recommendationReason` | String | The reason why we recommend this address       |
| `followerCount`        | Int    | The number of recommended address' followers   |

## Example

This is an example of a query to fetch `recommendations` data that you can also test out in the [Playground](/cyberconnect-api/playground/):

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs
    defaultValue="javascript"
    values={[
        {label: 'Query', value: 'javascript'},
        {label: 'Response', value: 'json'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript
query QueryRecommendation {
    recommendations(
        address: "0x148d59faf10b52063071eddf4aaf63a395f2d41c"
        filter: SOCIAL
        network: ETH
        first: 1
    ) {
        result
        data {
            pageInfo {
                startCursor
                endCursor
                hasNextPage
                hasPreviousPage
            }
            list {
                address
                domain
                avatar
                recommendationReason
                followerCount
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json">

        ]
      }
    }
