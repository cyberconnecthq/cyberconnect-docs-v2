An interoperable social graph opens up the possibility for developers to better leverage data insights and more accurately recommend potential connections to their users. The recommender layer of the CyberConnect Protocol enables several types of algorithms to retrieve lists of recommended users:
<ul>
    <li>Asset-based weighted recommendation.</li>
    <li>Connection-based weighted recommendation.</li>
    <li>Unweighted recommendation (by overall popularity).</li>
    <li>Customizable recommendation.</li>
</ul>

Developers can leverage those insights to build better social experiences by making a simple call to the [CyberConnect API](/cyberconnect-api/overview/).
