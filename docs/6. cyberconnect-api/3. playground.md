You can access the API through a variety of interfaces that support GraphQL. Below you will find some examples of how you can use the CyberConnect API.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is an interactive interface where you can construct mutations and queries alongside easy access to the API's schema.

:::caution

Please be sure to use [https://api.cybertino.io/connect/](https://api.cybertino.io/connect/) as the URL in the playground.

:::

An easy way to explore the CyberConnect API is to use the GraphiQL interface served directly on the endpoint address either by accessing [https://api.cybertino.io/connect/graphiql](https://api.cybertino.io/connect/graphiql) to do so or playing around with the embedded version:

### Example query

```graphql
query IdentityQuery{
    identity(address: "0x148d59faf10b52063071eddf4aaf63a395f2d41c", network: ETH) {
        domain
    }
}
```

### Example result data
```json
{
  "data": {
        "identity": {
            "domain": "cyberlab.eth"
        }
    }
}
```

## HTTP

You can access CyberConnect API through standard HTTP by simply sending a GraphQL query to the endpoint through a POST request. The response will be in JSON.

If you intend to use CyberConnect API in a programmatic context (like within JavaScript or Python), it is recommended to use a GraphQL client such as Relay or Apollo.

### Example using cURL

```bash
curl https://api.cybertino.io/connect/ \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"query":"query {\n identity(address: \"0x7C04786F04c522ca664Bb8b6804E0d182eec505F\") {\n ens\n\t}\n}"}'
```
