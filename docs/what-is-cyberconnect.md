## Blogging with crowdfunding

Developers can build social dApp with CyberConnect protocol to store and manage users’ social data such as profiles, posts, and content in a decentralized manner. Also, users can publish their data in NFT format on a chosen blockchain for monetization purposes. For example, the content creator can publish 100 editions for their blog with a price of 14 $CYBER tokens per edition and only allow their subscriber to collect such content NFT.

## SBT/NFT issuing platform

Utilizing airdrops and tokens to attract early adopters, convert them to contributors and retain them through rewards like badges is a popular and proven practice among top Web3 projects. The protocol enables communities to build large audiences with social data that lives on CyberConnect as ERC-721 NFTs. Community tooling applications use CyberConnect to power community profiles and reward members to participate in activities with badges issued through the protocol.

## Recommendation

Developers can utilize CyberConnect to get interesting recommendation data when they build their social dApp. For example, the protocol can generate a list of recommended people to follow based on users’ relationships and social data from both off-chain and on-chain sources. Also, a list of recommended tokens to purchase can be generated based on modeling trading behavior & holdings relative to other addresses (i.e. collaborative filtering model).
