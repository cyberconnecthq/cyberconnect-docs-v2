description: The CyberConnect Protocol allows users to get notifications in time.
---

The CyberConnect Protocol allows users to get notifications when:
<ul>
    <li>Someone follows them.</li>
    <li>Their friend request is accepted.</li>
    <li>They receive a friend request.</li>
    <li>Other scenarios to be addedâ€¦</li>
</ul>

Users will also be able to acknowledge these notifications by marking them as read.

Developers can incorporate notification modules to diversify the user experience by using the [CyberConnect JS SDK](/cyberconnect-sdk/connect-with-js-sdk/) and [CyberConnect API](/cyberconnect-api/overview/).
