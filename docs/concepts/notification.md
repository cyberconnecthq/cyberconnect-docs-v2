description: The CyberConnect Protocol allows users to get notifications in time.

Notifications are chronological messages that users need to check to keep them updated. The CyberConnect Protocol allows users to get notifications when:
<ul>
    <li>Someone follows them.</li>
    <li>They receive a friend request.</li>
    <li>Their friend request is accepted.</li>
    <li>Other scenarios to be addedâ€¦</li>
</ul>

After receiving notifications, users can:
<ul>
    <li>Acknowledge a portion of notifications.</li>
    <li>Acknowledge all of notifications.</li>
</ul>

So that these notifications are marked as "read" to users.

Developers can incorporate notification modules to diversify the user experience by using the [CyberConnect JS SDK](/cyberconnect-sdk/connect-with-js-sdk/) and [CyberConnect API](/cyberconnect-api/overview/).
