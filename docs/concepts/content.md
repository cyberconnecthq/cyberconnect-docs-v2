Web3 Status Token or W3ST (pronounced as “west”) is the web3 native way of recognizing, owning and utilizing one’s status.

Each profile could create a new piece of content in the form of a post just like that on twitter or medium. However, by having those posts live on CyberConnect protocol, these posts become web3 native instrument for community engagement and financialization through users collecting those posts. Developers could create a content platform linked to funding public good where users could contribute some amount of token to each piece of article.
