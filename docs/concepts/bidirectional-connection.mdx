The CyberConnect Protocol allows users to establish bidirectional connections that are recorded and verified on blockchain networks. This bidirectional connection can be used to express “friends” relationship in some social contexts, but we are not limiting the use cases for it.

There are four states for each address in a bidirectional connection: `EMPTY`、`PENDING`、`CONNECTD` and `BLACKLIST`.

The protocol defines different types of bidirectional connections for different situations:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Init</strong>: Sends request to another wallet address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accept</strong>: Accepts the request from another wallet address and
    establishes a bidirectional connection with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reject</strong>: Rejects the request from another wallet address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Terminate</strong>: Terminates the established bidirectional
    connection with another wallet address。
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Block</strong>: Blocks the request from another wallet address, also
    will terminate the bidirectional connection if there is already one between
    you and the address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unblock</strong>: Remove the wallet address from the blacklist, and
    is able to receive the request from it.
  </li>
</ul>

:::note

The bidirectional connection model has nothing to do with the “friends” in the current CyberConnect product. The CyberConnect product currently defines “friends” using mutual “follow” between two individuals, which are two unilateral connections under the hook.

:::

Developers can incorporate various connection modules to diversify the user experience by using the [CyberConnect JS SDK](/cyberconnect-sdk/connect-with-js-sdk/) and [CyberConnect GraphQL API](/cyberconnect-api/graphql-api/bidirectional-connections/).

## How does it work?

Let’s take “init” as an example. A user clicking the “add“ button in an application invokes the “bidirectionalConnect” function in the CyberConnect JavaScript library. If this is their first bidirectional connection in the current session, they need to manually sign the message. The CyberConnect library then generates and stores a derived key to authorize writing directional connection data onto IPFS and Arweave storage.
