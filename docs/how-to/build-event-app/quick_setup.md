3. [Create an Event](/how-to/build-event-app/create-an-event)

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer andÂ [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension in your Chrome browser.

## Installation

Clone the repo [https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cc-event-app.git](https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/cc-event-app.git) and run the following command in your terminal to install all the packages that are necessary to start the development server: `npm install` or `yarn install`.

## Local Development

To start the local development server run the command `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` and open up the browser window http://localhost:3000. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Live demo
