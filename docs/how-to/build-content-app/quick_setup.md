This guide will teach you how to create your own content application from scratch using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

## Installation

Make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer andÂ [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension in your Chrome browser. Once they are installed you can open the terminal and run the command:

```bash
npx create-react-app cc-content-app --template typescript
```

or

```bash
yarn create-react-app cc-content-app --template typescript
```

## Apollo client

Since you will be using the [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) library to query the CyberConnect API, now it's a good time to open the in the terminal in the main directory of your app and install the following packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

## Full code
