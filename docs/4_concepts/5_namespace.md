description: Major Concepts of CyberConnect
---

By default, every user and interaction happens in a global namespace called “CyberConnect” to maximize user liquidity. At the same time, CyberConnect enables developers create social experiences in their own namespace where each user goes thru a “sign up” process by creating their profiles within that namespace and creating content and social connections in that namespace. This gives developers more power and control of their user flow and monetization.
