description: Major Concepts of CyberConnect
---

To enable dynamic rules involved in collecting contents and paid subscription, CyberConnect protocol provides various middlewares. There are two types of middlewares, `CollectMiddleware` and `SubscribeMiddleware`. They are smart contracts with logic executed before and after `collect` and `subscribe` happens. Currently we support `PaidCollect` and `PaidSubscirbe` where users need to pay ERC20 token to collect a content or subscribe to a profile. We also support `PermissionedCollect` where the creator of the content specifies a whitelist.
