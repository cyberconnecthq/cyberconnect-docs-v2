[Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) is a collection of common Ethereum development tools for developers to quickly deploy Solidity smart contracts and launch DApps with a React frontend and a deployed subgraph. There are premade templates for common DApp types such as NFTs, ERC-20 tokens, multi-sig wallets, simple DEXs, etc.

This CyberConnect Starter Kit integrates CyberConnect SDK and API to Scaffold-ETH so that developers can have a general sense of how easy it is to build and launch DApps with CyberConnect features including reading an address’s identity, its social connections, and allowing users to follow and unfollow each other.

Check out the video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ3sUdxdNlk).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## **Install Scaffold-ETH**

We'll be working with the [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth). For installation, simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

After the download completes, run:

```bash
yarn install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed without error, you can start modifying the different Scaffold-ETH components.

## Install Dependencies

Go to the React frontend directory:

```bash
cd packages\react-app
```

Run:

```bash
yarn add @cyberlab/cyberconnect graphql graphql-request babel-core babel-preset-env gulp-babel
```

To learn more about CyberConnect JS SDK, please read [Connect with JS SDK](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/cyberconnect-sdk/connect-with-js-sdk/). We are using GraphQL to query our data, you can check this [link](https://graphql.org/) to learn more. [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) is the simplest and the most lightweight GraphQL client. [`@babel/preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) is a toolchain for converting ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backward-compatible version of JavaScript in the current and legend browsers and environments.

## Modify Configuration

- Open **packages\react-app\gulpfile.js** and modify the code as follows:

```jsx title="packages\react-app\gulpfile.js"
const gulp = require("gulp");
const gulpless = require("gulp-less");
const postcss = require("gulp-postcss");
const debug = require("gulp-debug");
var csso = require("gulp-csso");
const autoprefixer = require("autoprefixer");
const NpmImportPlugin = require("less-plugin-npm-import");
const babel = require("gulp-babel");

gulp.task(
  "less",
  gulp.parallel(
    function () {
      const plugins = [autoprefixer()];

      return gulp
        .src("src/themes/*-theme.less")
        .pipe(debug({ title: "Less files:" }))
        .pipe(
          gulpless({
            javascriptEnabled: true,
            plugins: [new NpmImportPlugin({ prefix: "~" })],
          }),
        )
        .pipe(postcss(plugins))
        .pipe(
          csso({
            debug: true,
          }),
        )
        .pipe(gulp.dest("./public"));
    },
    () =>
      gulp
        .src("src/app.js")
        .pipe(
          babel({
            plugins: ["@babel/transform-runtime"],
          }),
        )
        .pipe(gulp.dest("./public")),
  ),
);
```
