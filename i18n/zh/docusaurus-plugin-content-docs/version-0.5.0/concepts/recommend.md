An interoperable [social graphs](/concepts/social-graph/) opens up the possibility for developers to better leverage data insights and more accurately recommend potential [connections](/concepts/connection/) to their users. The recommender layer of the CyberConnect Protocol enables several types of algorithms to retrieve lists of recommended users:
<ul>
    <li>Asset-based weighted recommendation.</li>
    <li>Connection-based weighted recommendation.</li>
    <li>Unweighted recommendation (by overall popularity).</li>
    <li>Customizable recommendation.</li>
</ul>

Developers can leverage those insights to build better social experiences by making a simple call to the [CyberConnect API](/cyberconnect-api/overview/).
