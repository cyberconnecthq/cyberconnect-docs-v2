:::tip

[Install the GraphQL packages](/get-started/quick-setup/) before starting this section.

:::

In this section, we'll help you write a simple query to read the ownership information of an NFT.

1. Initialize the GraphQL client:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetNFTOwnership.tsx"
const client = new GraphQLClient(CYBERCONNECT_ENDPOINT);
```

2. Write a query to get the NFT's `tokenId`, its `owner`, and the owner's twitter `handle`:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetNFTOwnership.tsx"
export const GET_NFT_OWNERSHIP = gql`
  query($contract: String!, $tokenId: String) {
    nftOwners(contract: $contract, tokenId: $tokenId) {
      tokenId
      owner
      twitter {
        handle
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

Make sure to check out the full list of fields available in the [CyberConnect API](/cyberconnect-api/overview/).

## Sandbox

You can write your own query in the [Playground](/cyberconnect-api/playground/) or experiment with our code in the sandbox below!
