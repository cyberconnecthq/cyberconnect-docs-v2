In simple terms, the CyberConnect social graph is a decentralized and tamper-proof address book that only allows data owners to modify, read, and port their connections across different platforms and applications.

The protocol is designed with data integrity and authenticity in mind. Each user's social graph is safely stored in IPFS with a custom IPLD codec ensuring that every update is signed and verified.

Learn more about it in our [Technical Framework](/protocol/technical-framework/).
